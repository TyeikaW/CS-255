The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system for a client whose goal was to improve driving test pass rates. The client, DriverPass, wanted a system that combined online practice exams with in-person driving lessons. They needed a web-based platform that allowed users to book appointments, access test materials, and track their progress. The system also required features for role-based access, secure data handling, and integration with DMV updates.

One area I excelled in was accurately interpreting the client’s needs and translating them into a structured design. From identifying the functional requirements to creating UML diagrams, I ensured that each element of the system aligned with DriverPass's goals. I was particularly effective in creating clear and logical workflows, such as the activity diagram for scheduling lessons, which captured the user's journey step by step.

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the security design section. While it covered essential elements like encryption and role-based access, I feel I could have expanded it by including specific examples of compliance standards, such as GDPR or PCI-DSS, to add more depth. Additionally, incorporating more detailed explanations of how these standards would be implemented could strengthen the overall design.

To address the user’s needs, I carefully reviewed the interview transcript and other client materials to understand their priorities. For example, the need for flexible scheduling and the ability to track lesson progress was implemented through modular design elements like the scheduling module and progress tracking system. Considering the user’s needs is vital in system design because it ensures the product is functional, user-friendly, and aligned with business objectives. Ignoring user needs can result in a system that fails to meet expectations or is difficult to use.

My approach to designing software focuses on a combination of user-centric and structured methodologies. I start by gathering comprehensive requirements and breaking them into functional and nonfunctional categories. Techniques like creating UML diagrams and employing iterative design help refine the system to ensure all needs are met. In the future, I plan to incorporate more user feedback during the design process to validate assumptions early and ensure the system is intuitive and effective.
